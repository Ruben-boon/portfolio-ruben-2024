create_module creates on comments like //bashcreateobj however it needs to have 0 spacing.
Make it so that the space infront doesnt matter since when formatting it gets removed

Next step:

Add the module to modules/index.tsx 

Add the option to add sanity field when creating the module.

Expand the module with the correct module imports and types

Currently i think the modules query imports all the top level queries automaticly, 
only if we need special "deep" types should we change this, i think creating these manual
is a fine way of handeling this
